1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The following abbreviations are used where convenient:

   Local Service Provider (LSP):  The Service Provider preferred by the
      referenced user.

   Remote Service Provider (RSP):  Any Service Provider which is not the
      LSP.

   Hub:  The Service Provider which created and hosts a referenced
      group.  Group messages and Welcome messages are always sent to the
      hub for sequencing and fanout.

   Follower:  Service Providers that interact with a hub to allow their
      users to interact with a group which the hub hosts.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Partition Keys

   A partition key is a short secret that group members export from the
   MLS key schedule.  Whenever members send or receive group messages,
   they provide the partition key for the current epoch.  Messages sent
   with a given partition key are only provided to users who request to
   receive messages with the same partition key.  (Exceptions may be
   selectively made for external commits / proposals, given that the
   sender isn't in the group yet.)

   The partition key acts as epoch-level access control, in addition to
   the group ID.  Users which have been removed from a group may still
   be able to message the group, as they know the group ID.  However,
   they will not know the correct partition key.

   Service Providers MUST NOT implement hard-and-fast rules about which
   partition keys are acceptable.  Instead, it should be considered as a
   general signal of abuse or spam.

4.  Endpoints

   The following endpoints are provided by a Delivery Service.  All
   endpoints exposed by a Delivery Service are accessed by third-party
   Service Providers, for the purpose of learning about the Service
   Provider's users or interacting with a group for which the Service
   Provider is the hub.

4.1.  Key Packages

   It's assumed that users have already interacted with a Discovery
   Service to learn the user ID and preferred Service Provider of their
   contacts.  As part of discovery, users also receive a bearer token
   associated with each contact.  The bearer token may or may not be
   unique to the user who requested it, depending on the RSP's
   preference.

   When a user wishes to fetch a KeyPackage for the purpose of adding a
   user to a group, the user submits a KeyPackageRequest to the RSP,
   with its LSP acting as an OHTTP proxy:

   struct {
     opaque user_id<V>;
     opaque bearer_token<V>;
     ProtocolVersion version;
     CipherSuite cipher_suite;
   } KeyPackageRequest;

   The user_id field contains the Service-Specific Identifier of the
   user, bearer_token contains the bearer token learned during
   discovery, and version and cipher_suite contain the desired MLS group
   parameters.  The RSP responds with a KeyPackageResponse structure
   that matches the requested parameters:

   struct {
     KeyPackage key_package;
   } KeyPackageResponse;

4.1.1.  Privacy

   Several KeyPackageRequest structures MAY be bundled into the same
   transaction, if a user needs KeyPackages from many users of the same
   service and is comfortable leaking that these users are associated.

   Note that the KeyPackageRequest and KeyPackageResponse structures are
   exchanged over OHTTP.  This is done primarily to prevent the LSP from
   learning who their local user wishes to contact, but it also
   restricts how much the RSP can learn about who wants to contact their
   user:

   To prevent abuse (such as constantly exhausting a user's uploaded
   KeyPackages), this endpoint is protected with a bearer token learned
   during discovery.  The RSP can construct the bearer token however it
   feels is necessary to preserve privacy and manage abuse.  If abuse is
   a non-issue, a bearer token can be long-lived and shared by every
   user.  Alternatively, users may be provided a uniquely identifying
   bearer token.  Bearer tokens that are abused may be invalidated at-
   will by the RSP, triggering users to go through the discovery flow
   again.

4.2.  Sending Messages

   When a follower has a user participating in a group, and that user
   wishes to send a message, the follower issues a SendRequest to the
   hub:

   opaque PartitionKey<16>;
   opaque ServiceProviderId<V>;

   struct {
     MLSMessage welcome; // Welcome
     ServiceProviderId service_providers<V>;
   } WelcomeData;

   struct {
     optional<MLSMessage> group_info; // GroupInfo
     optional<WelcomeData> welcome_data;
   } CommitData;

   struct {
     MLSMessage message; // PublicMessage or PrivateMessage
     PartitionKey partition_key;
     select (SendRequest.message.content_type) {
       case application:
       case proposal:
       case commit:
         CommitData commit_data;
     }
   } SendRequest;

   The hub rejects the message if the group_id of message doesn't match
   any known group.  Otherwise, the hub sequences the message to the
   providedpartition_key` of the group, and pushes the Welcome to any
   providers.

   If the message is a commit, then a CommitData is provided which
   contains an optional GroupInfo in group_info if external joining is
   supported.  If any Welcome messages need to be sent, a WelcomeData is
   provided which contains the Welcome in welcome, and a list of service
   provider ids in service_providers.  The service_providers array MUST
   be the same length as the secrets array of the Welcome message.  Each
   provider indicated in service_providers corresponds one-to-one with
   the user at the same entry in the secrets array.

   If group_info does not have a ratchet_tree extension and the hub is
   unable to infer a ratchet tree that matches
   GroupInfo.group_context.tree_hash, the hub rejects the request such
   that it can be retried with an explicit ratchet tree provided.

4.3.  Welcome

   When a user of a non-hub Service Provider is added to a group, the
   hub first contacts the Service Provider and lists the KeyPackageRef
   entries that were indicated as belonging to this Service Provider.
   If the Service Provider responds affirmatively, the hub pushes the
   Welcome message.

   The first step is done by sending a WelcomeInitRequest to the Service
   Provider:

   struct {
     KeyPackageRef key_package_refs<V>;
   } WelcomeInitRequest;

   The Welcome message is provided as an encoded MLSMessage.

4.4.  Receiving Messages

   When a follower has a user participating in a group, and that user
   wishes to receive a message, the follower issues a ReceiveRequest to
   the hub:

   struct {
     PartitionKey partition_key;
     uint32 counter;
   } ReceiveRequest;

   The partition_key field contains the partition key that the user
   wishes to receive messages for, and the counter field contains the
   number of messages the user has already received in that partition.
   The hub responds with the following, which represents a series of
   messages in a series of epochs:

   opaque MaskedPartitionKey<V>;

   struct {
     MLSMessage message; // PublicMessage or PrivateMessage
     select (Message.message.content_type) {
       case application:
       case proposal:
       case commit:
         optional<MLSMessage> group_info; // GroupInfo
     }
   } Message;

   struct {
     Message messages<V>;
   } Epoch;

   struct {
     MaskedPartitionKey masked_partition_key; // = Hash(partition_key)
     Epoch epoch;
   } HintedEpoch;

   struct {
     Epoch epoch;
     HintedEpoch hints<V>;
   } ReceiveResponse;

   The epoch field contains a list of messages sent to the requested
   partition_key, skipping the first counter messages.  Messages sent to
   other epochs may be provided in hints.  Each HintedEpoch structure
   contains a masked partition key and a list of messages sent to that
   partition key (skipping none).

   The same epoch may not be referenced twice separately in the same
   ReceiveResponse.  No order between epochs may be inferred by the
   order in hints.  However, the order of the messages array in each
   Epoch does reflect the order that the messages were sequenced and
   should be processed.

5.  Policy Enforcement

   Generally, a hub or follower DS is only able to enforce "negative"
   policy on the aspects of the group state that it has visiblity into.
   "Negative" policy consists of rules for rejecting messages which are
   unambiguously invalid.  Examples of such rules might include
   rejecting application messages from a user that is muted, or
   rejecting a commit that contains an Add proposal for a banned user.

   Keeping in mind that the group may fork when there are buggy or
   malicious clients, but that clients clearly indicate which fork they
   are sending their message to, the DS must always make policy
   enforcmenent decisions with respect to the group state as it exists
   in the indicated fork.  If one fork of a group exists where a
   proposal was sent that updated the group metadata to ban a specific
   user, but another fork exists where this proposal was not sent (or
   not accepted), the ban must only apply in the fork that accepted the
   proposal.

   A DS MUST NOT reject messages based on criteria that are not
   unambiguously known by the DS to be satisfied.  In particular, a DS
   can not enforce a per-user rate limit on messages sent to the group
   for any users that are not local to the DS.  When the DS has a local
   relationship with a user, the DS can authenticate the user and
   unambiguously rate-limit just them.  However, a hub DS can not rate-
   limit a follower DS's users without speculating on an MLS message's
   content.

   It's understood that hub servers will make arrangements with follower
   servers, where the follower server enforces the hub's policies in
   situations where the hub can not, as a precondition to interoperate.
   This includes rate limits but also for example, if one of the
   follower server's users are banned by the hub, enforcing that the
   banned user is not allowed in any groups hosted by the hub.  (Noting
   that the hub would be unable to ban a follower server's user
   themselves, in cases where a group's handshake messages are
   encrypted.)

   Ultimately, while a DS can reject _some_ abusive messages, clients
   must be aware of the policy a group is under and enforce it
   themselves.  Messages which violate the group's policy MUST be
   ignored and supressed by the UI, as if they were cryptographically
   invalid.  Clients SHOULD report to their local DS when the hub or
   another follower is not meeting the preconditions to interoperate.

   A DS MUST NOT enforce "positive" policy decisions, consisting of
   rules that require a given message to be accepted by the members of
   the group.
