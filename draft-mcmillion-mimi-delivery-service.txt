1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy Enforcement

   Generally, a hub or follower DS is only able to enforce "negative"
   policy on the aspects of the group state that it has visiblity into.
   "Negative" policy consists of rules for rejecting messages which are
   unambiguously invalid.  Examples of such rules might include
   rejecting application messages from a user that is muted, or
   rejecting a commit that contains an Add proposal for a banned user.

   Keeping in mind that the group may fork when there are buggy or
   malicious clients, but that clients clearly indicate which fork they
   are sending their message to, the DS must always make policy
   enforcmenent decisions with respect to the group state as it exists
   in the indicated fork.  If one fork of a group exists where a
   proposal was sent that updated the group metadata to ban a specific
   user, but another fork exists where this proposal was not sent (or
   not accepted), the ban must only apply in the fork that accepted the
   proposal.

   A DS MUST NOT reject messages based on criteria that are not
   unambiguously known by the DS to be satisfied.  In particular, a DS
   can not enforce a per-user rate limit on messages sent to the group
   for any users that are not local to the DS.  When the DS has a local
   relationship with a user, the DS can authenticate the user and
   unambiguously rate-limit just them.  However, a hub DS can not rate-
   limit a follower DS's users without speculating on an MLS message's
   content.

   It's understood that hub servers will make arrangements with follower
   servers, where the follower server enforces the hub's policies in
   situations where the hub can not, as a precondition to interoperate.
   This includes rate limits but also for example, if one of the
   follower server's users are banned by the hub, enforcing that the
   banned user is not allowed in any groups hosted by the hub.  (Noting
   that the hub would be unable to ban a follower server's user
   themselves, in cases where a group's handshake messages are
   encrypted.)

   Ultimately, while a DS can reject _some_ abusive messages, clients
   must be aware of the policy a group is under and enforce it
   themselves.  Messages which violate the group's policy MUST be
   ignored and supressed by the UI, as if they were cryptographically
   invalid.  Clients SHOULD report to their local DS when the hub or
   another follower is not meeting the preconditions to interoperate.

   A DS MUST NOT enforce "positive" policy decisions, consisting of
   rules that require a given message to be accepted by the members of
   the group.

4.  IANA Considerations
